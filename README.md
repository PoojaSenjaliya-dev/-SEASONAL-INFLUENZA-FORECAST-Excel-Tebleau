# **SEASONAL-INFLUENZA-FORECAST-Excel-Tebleau** #

During flu season, U.S. healthcare facilities experience an influx of patients. This project aimed to create a staffing schedule that addresses the critical staffing demands during the flu season.

## PROJECT OVERVIEWL

### Goal: 
Enhance preparedness for the influenza season by effectively managing staffing needs at clinics and hospitals served by the medical staffing agency.

### Motivation:
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.

### Scope: 
The scope of the analysis encompasses examining historical influenza data, including incidence rates, peak seasons, and regional variations, to forecast staffing needs across the country. It involves identifying patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and high-risk periods for influenza outbreaks. Additionally, the analysis will assess the implications of influenza trends on the demand for temporary healthcare workers, considering factors such as clinic size, patient demographics, and geographic location.

## Data and Tools Used:

2 datasets were used throughout this project:

● Influenza deaths by geography - From the CDC

● Population data by geography, time, age, and gender - From the US Census Bureau

Excel and Tableau Public were used throughout this project.

## KEY QUESTIONS

 ● When is flu season at its peak?
 
 ● Who is most vulnerable?
 
 ● Which states have the most residents in vulnerable populations?

 ## Folders:

Project files are stored using the following folder structure:

● 1. Project Management: Contains project brief, early planning/management documentation, and data sourcing documentation.

● 2. Original Data: Contains original data files from the CDC and US Census Bureau

● 3. Data Prep and Analysis: Contains Excel files documenting data cleaning, integration, and statistical hypothesis testing. Also contains pdfs of processes that lead to the development of Tableau visualisations.

# **SEASONAL-INFLUENZA-FORECAST-Excel-Tebleau** #

During flu season, U.S. healthcare facilities experience an influx of patients. This project aimed to create a staffing schedule that addresses the critical staffing demands during the flu season.

## PROJECT OVERVIEWL

### Goal: 
Enhance preparedness for the influenza season by effectively managing staffing needs at clinics and hospitals served by the medical staffing agency.

### Motivation:
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.

### Scope: 
The scope of the analysis encompasses examining historical influenza data, including incidence rates, peak seasons, and regional variations, to forecast staffing needs across the country. It involves identifying patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and high-risk periods for influenza outbreaks. Additionally, the analysis will assess the implications of influenza trends on the demand for temporary healthcare workers, considering factors such as clinic size, patient demographics, and geographic location.
